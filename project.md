Does the amount of MeHg in freshwater streams vary in watersheds that experience different kinds of logging intensity? 

My data was collected as an extension to a project started by the Forest Research Advisory Committee, funded by J.D. Irving, Limited (JDI).
JDI is interested in knowing how their intensive harvesting practices impact the levels of MeHg in stream water in the watershed. 
Two other watersheds with an “extensive” level of forestry and a minimal amount of forestry also had MeHg levels measured and are used
for comparison. The main question being asked is does MeHg levels vary between watersheds that experience different harvesting intensities?

Water chemistry was also measured at each site and there is research that showed there is an inverse relationship between pH and MeHg 
levels in freshwater streams. Leading me to ask is there a correlation between pH in the stream water and MeHg levels measured in a 
watershed?

To consider with each question: is there a spatial relationship between headwater and downstream sites within a watershed? 
Particularly, we want to see if there is a dilution or accumulation of MeHg/pH as you travel downstream.
